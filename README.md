# dc-mapper
A small script for mapping partnerships between different Discord servers and data visualization. dc-mapper makes use of adaptive proxy rotation to bypass rate limiting on invite-related API endpoints, and uses Selenium to interact with the online version of Discord. A word of warning, use a throwaway account when testing this.

Since the online interface of Discord is prone to change, the current algorithms will most likely refuse to work with newer versions. This is just a quick 'n dirty, proof of concept script. Expect spectacular bugs.

For a summary of the algorithm, and possible use cases, see my blog post at [Ominous.tech](https://ominous.tech/posts/kie-a-hatalom/).

## Features
* Login with session token or email/password
* Request available servers
* Look for invite links in messages
* Request invite information
* Join and leave new servers
* Save the resulting directed graph as JSON
* Export a version compatible with graph visualization libraries
